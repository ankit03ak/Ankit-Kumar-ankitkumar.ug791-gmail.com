\# BUILD-LOG



Append to this as you go. Commit it with the code it describes — the timestamps are part of the

evidence, and a log that arrives in one commit at the end reads as what it is.



Five lines is a real entry. Short and dated is better than long and reconstructed.



The categories we look for are listed in `DISCOVERY-BRIEF.md`. The example below shows the

\*shape\* of a good entry; it is a recreation of something already printed in `README.md`, so it

gives nothing away.

\## Phase 0 — orientation



## 2026-09-27 · Phase 0 — orientation

Expected the starter suites to expose the main implementation gaps before I changed application code.

Observed: the JWT suite passed all 43 checks, the permissions suite passed, and the API suite passed all 66 checks after fixing a Windows path issue in `scripts/load-db.js`. The Playwright suite initially failed because the production server could not serve the SPA correctly on Windows.

Changed: fixed `scripts/load-db.js` to resolve the database script path without using `.pathname`, then fixed the production `dist` path in `server/index.js` using `fileURLToPath(new URL(...))`. After rebuilding, all Playwright UI tests passed.

Evidence: `node scripts/check-jwt.js` → 43 passed; `node scripts/check-api.js` → 66 passed; `npx playwright test` → all tests passed.

\## Phase 1 — token verification



\_What did you expect each failure mode to look like before you ran it? Which one behaved

differently from your expectation, and what did that tell you?\_



\## Phase 2 — caller context and the resolution engine



\_This is where most people's first model is wrong. Write down the model you started with, the

observation that broke it, and the model you moved to. Be specific about the observation.\_



\## Phase 3 — orgs, members, invites



\_Anything you had to work out that no document states. Invite lifecycle states are a common

source of this.\_



\## Phase 4 — devices and grants



\_What happens at the boundary where two grants disagree, or where a grant's scope and the

question's scope differ? Say what you predicted and what you got.\_



\## Phase 5 — sessions



\_Two permissions, one device. What did you have to resolve, and in what order, to keep the two

failure reasons distinguishable?\_



\## Phase 6 — audit



\_What did you decide counts as an auditable event, and what pushed you to that line?\_



\## Phase 7 — the console



\_Where did the server's answer and your instinct disagree about what should be on screen?\_



\## Phase 8 — hardening



\_What did you measure, what did you fix, and what did you deliberately leave alone? Anything you

chose not to build belongs here with its reason.\_



\## Open threads



\_Things you know are wrong, unfinished, or that you would do differently with another day. Listing

these honestly is worth more than pretending they do not exist — we will find them anyway.\_
